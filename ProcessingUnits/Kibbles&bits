## Abstract

This document proposes **KbLS (Kilobyte Laser System)**, a conceptual photonic compute architecture that uses a **single coherent laser** to perform **multi-bit, multi-channel computation** by exploiting the full state space of the optical field.

Instead of treating a laser as a one-dimensional amplitude carrier (one laser = one bitstream), KbLS models the beam as a **high-dimensional state vector** spanning:

- frequency (wavelength) modes  
- polarization states  
- spatial / orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes  
- temporal / oscillation-stage information  

Computation is implemented by routing this multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DoF) state through a **programmable photonic core** composed of interferometers, resonators, and phase shifters. Logical bits and numeric values are extracted by sampling the **oscillation stage** and geometry of the wave, rather than simply thresholding intensity.

The goal is a **photonic GPU core** which:
- dramatically lowers energy per bit (many bits per laser)  
- uses optical interference and phase evolution as its native math engine  
- stays compatible with existing electronic systems via standard I/O and control interfaces.

## 1. Motivation

Conventional photonic links and compute systems often assume:

- one laser ≈ one channel  
- one channel ≈ one bitstream  
- bits are recovered by intensity thresholding at a detector.

Under this model, lasers appear **energy-inefficient** when considered on a per-bit basis, especially compared to aggressively scaled CMOS.

However, a coherent laser beam is not a one-dimensional object. Physically, the optical field carries information in:

- amplitude  
- phase  
- polarization  
- spatial structure  
- mode index (e.g., OAM)  

Treating all of this as a “single channel” wastes almost all of the available structure.

KbLS starts from a different premise:

> A single coherent laser beam is a **multi-dimensional state**, and bits should be defined in terms of its **oscillation stage and geometry**, not just its raw intensity.

## 2. Beam as a High-Dimensional State Vector

We model the laser output as a coherent field:

\[
E(t) = A_0 e^{i(\omega_0 t + \phi_0)} \, \mathbf{v}_0
\]

where:

- \(A_0\) is the baseline amplitude  
- \(\omega_0\) is the carrier angular frequency  
- \(\phi_0\) is the initial phase  
- \(\mathbf{v}_0\) encodes polarization and spatial structure.

After KbLS’s **multi-DoF encoder**, the beam becomes:

\[
\Psi_\text{in} = \{ A_m e^{i \phi_m} \}_{m=1}^{M}
\]

Each index \(m\) corresponds to a particular combination of:

- wavelength / frequency  
- polarization state  
- spatial / OAM mode  
- time slot or oscillation stage  

The total optical energy is:

\[
U = \sum_{m=1}^{M} |A_m|^2
\]

If we encode \(k\) logical bits into these \(M\) complex amplitudes and phases, the **energy per bit** becomes:

\[
E_\text{bit} = \frac{U}{k}
\]

Traditional systems implicitly assume \(k \approx 1\) for each laser.  
KbLS aims for \(k \gg 1\) by exploiting multi-DoF encoding.

## 3. Information as Oscillation Stage

In intensity-based systems, bits are recovered via simple thresholding:

\[
\text{bit} =
\begin{cases}
1, & I > T \\
0, & I \le T
\end{cases}
\]

KbLS instead treats **oscillation stage** and **phase** as core components of the encoding.  
Define the instantaneous phase of a mode as:

\[
\theta_m(t) = \omega_m t + \phi_m
\]

and let:

\[
\theta_m^\ast = \theta_m(t) \bmod 2\pi
\]

We can map different phase regions to symbols:

- 2 regions → 1 bit per sample  
- 4 regions → 2 bits per sample  
- 8 regions → 3 bits per sample, etc.

More generally:

\[
b_k = f_k\big( \theta_m^\ast, A_m, \text{mode index } m \big)
\]

This means that **bits are recovered from where the wave is in its oscillation cycle**, and from which mode it occupies, rather than simply “how bright it is.”

## 4. KbLS Top-Level Architecture

KbLS is organized into the following major blocks:

1. **Power & Clock Subsystem**  
2. **Master Laser & Stabilization**  
3. **Multi-DoF Encoder (Input Front-End)**  
4. **Optical Distribution & Mode Routing Network**  
5. **Photonic Compute Core (Matrix / Convolution Engine)**  
6. **State-Tap & Monitoring Layer (Non-Destructive Probes)**  
7. **Demux & Readout (Bit / Vector Extraction)**  
8. **Electronic Control, Memory & Host Interface**

### 4.1 Power & Clock Subsystem

- Provides stable electrical power.
- Distributes a reference clock for:
  - phase sampling windows,
  - synchronization with external systems,
  - timing of oscillation-stage measurements.

### 4.2 Master Laser & Stabilization

- Coherent laser diode / fiber laser.  
- Temperature and frequency stabilization (e.g., TEC + reference cavity).  
- Intensity stabilization via feedback.

Generates the parent beam with controlled amplitude, frequency, and phase.

### 4.3 Multi-DoF Encoder (Input Front-End)

Transforms the single input beam into a **multi-channel state**:

- **WDM modulation** to create multiple frequency channels.  
- **Polarization modulation** to encode auxiliary bits or control flags.  
- **High-speed phase modulation** to encode oscillation-stage-controlled information.  
- **Spatial / OAM modulation** to place logical channels into distinct spatial / vortex modes.

The output of this block is the high-dimensional state vector \(\Psi_\text{in}\).

### 4.4 Optical Distribution & Mode Routing Network

- Waveguide splitters / combiners.  
- Directional couplers and mode sorters.  
- Polarization beam splitters / rotators.

This network routes specific subsets of modes to different regions of the compute core, similar to how an electronic crossbar routes data to different functional units.

### 4.5 Photonic Compute Core

The core implements linear transformations on \(\Psi\) using:

- **MZI (Mach–Zehnder interferometer) meshes** for arbitrary unitary / linear transforms.  
- **Resonators and delay lines** to exploit controlled phase evolution and temporal behavior.  
- Optional nonlinear elements for activation-like functions.

Mathematically, the core applies a matrix \(\mathbf{U}\) to the state:

\[
\Psi_\text{out} = \mathbf{U} \, \Psi_\text{in}
\]

By programming the phase shifters and couplers inside the mesh, KbLS can implement dense matrices, convolutions, and other GPU-like operations.

### 4.6 State-Tap & Monitoring Layer

- Weak couplers extract a small fraction of power from selected modes.  
- Reference interferometers compare tapped signals to a stable reference.  
- Feedback loops correct slow drifts in:
  - master laser phase,  
  - MZI bias points,  
  - resonator detuning.

These non-destructive taps let KbLS:

- maintain calibration,  
- verify oscillation-stage mapping,  
- optionally enable feedback-based algorithms.

### 4.7 Demux & Readout

At the far end of the compute core:

- Mode demultiplexers separate:
  - OAM / spatial modes,  
  - wavelengths,  
  - polarization channels.
- Coherent receivers sample:
  - amplitude,
  - phase,
  - polarization at specific time / phase windows.
- Oscillation-stage samplers map phase regions to multi-bit symbols.
- Photodiodes and ADCs convert optical states to digital vectors.

The result is a set of numerical outputs (vectors, matrices, or feature maps) suitable for further electronic processing.

### 4.8 Electronic Control, Memory & Host Interface

An electronic controller:

- Programs the phase shifters and resonators (effectively writing the matrices / kernels).  
- Manages data injection and readout timing.  
- Exposes a host interface (e.g., PCIe / CXL) so KbLS appears as a coprocessor or accelerator.

## 5. Relationship to Solar Cells and Photodiodes

Solar panels and photodiodes already interact with oscillating EM fields, but they are optimized for **energy harvesting**, not information preservation.

- A solar cell absorbs a portion of the incoming field, creating electron-hole pairs.  
- Each absorption event reduces the local field amplitude and alters the field state.  
- After enough interactions, coherence is effectively lost.

In contrast, KbLS:

- Avoids absorption inside the compute core.  
- Uses mirrors, couplers, and interference to manipulate the wave **without collapsing it**.  
- Only performs destructive measurement at the final readout stage, or in carefully controlled taps.

Both systems “sample” the oscillation state of the wave, but with very different goals:

- Solar cells → maximize energy conversion.  
- KbLS → preserve and transform coherent structure to perform computation.
