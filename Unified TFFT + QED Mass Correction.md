# Unified TFFT + QED Mass Correction
*Addendum to the Temporal Flow Field Theory Series*  
**Date:** 2025-11-04 — *Draft Interpretation Section*

## Abstract
We present the composite equation that merges **Temporal Flow Field Theory (TFFT)** with the **Quantum Electrodynamic (QED)** self-interaction term.  
The result expresses fermion mass as a geometric–field dual quantity: a product of frozen time-curvature (TFFT) and electromagnetic vacuum feedback (QED).  
This formulation supplies a mechanical origin for renormalization and reveals the periodic structure underlying coupling evolution.

## 1 · Unified Expression

\[
m_{\text{corr}} =
\frac{\hbar}{2 c^{2} \Delta t}
\!\left[
1 +
\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}
\Big(
\log\!\frac{1}{\Delta t Q}
+ \cos\!\frac{2\pi Q \Delta t}{\hbar}
\Big)
\right]
\]

Where  
- \( \Delta t \) — intrinsic temporal wavelength of the particle (TFFT)  
- \( Q \) — probing momentum-transfer scale  
- \( \alpha \) — fine-structure constant

## 2 · Term-by-Term Interpretation

| Term | Physical Role | Conceptual Domain |
|:--|:--|:--|
| \( \frac{\hbar}{2c^{2}\Delta t} \) | **Temporal inertia**: baseline mass from frozen curvature in the time dimension | TFFT geometry |
| \( \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\log(1/\Delta t Q) \) | **Running correction**: logarithmic self-consistency of charge in curved time | QED renormalization |
| \( \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\cos(2\pi Q\Delta t/\hbar) \) | **Resonance feedback**: oscillatory interference between EM field and temporal lattice | TFFT geometric modulation |

Together these encode both the smooth running of QED and the discrete Δt quantization of TFFT.

## 3 · Physical Interpretation

1. **Temporal Inertia (TFFT Core)**  
   Mass arises from resistance to acceleration *through time curvature*.  
   Smaller Δt ⇒ stronger temporal compression ⇒ greater mass.

2. **Vacuum Feedback (QED Response)**  
   The electromagnetic field slightly re-polarizes around that curvature,  
   producing the familiar logarithmic correction.

3. **Resonant Modulation (TFFT ↔ QED Bridge)**  
   The cosine term adds periodic fine structure—the geometric echo of  
   time-curvature interacting with virtual photon modes.  
   Constructive regions increase effective mass; destructive regions reduce it.

## 4 · Conceptual Summary

| Level | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Geometry** | Time possesses inertia; mass is the stored curvature of frozen temporal flow. |
| **Field Theory** | QED quantifies how the EM field re-equilibrates around that curvature. |
| **Unification** | The vacuum renormalizes because time itself oscillates in discrete curvature packets, producing the same logarithmic and periodic corrections observed in QED. |

Thus, QED emerges as the *field-theoretic projection* of a deeper geometric process:  
> **Renormalization is the vacuum’s temporal self-adjustment.**

## 5 · Next Steps

- Fit the unified model to the nine charged fermions using Δt values from the Planck-band table.  
- Compare predicted oscillations in \( \alpha(Q) \) with precision LHC and g-2 data.  
- Examine whether the periodic term explains residual deviations between perturbative QED and experimental fine-structure constants.  
- Extend formulation to the QCD coupling to test universal Δt-based running.
