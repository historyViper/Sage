## 3 · Dimensional Band Classification

By comparing Δt/tₚ ratios, we define three coupling regimes based on log₁₀(Δt/tₚ):

| Band | log₁₀(Δt/tₚ) Range | Representative Particles | Dimensional Behavior |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **4D-locked** | < 17.0 | t | Deep time-frozen; fully temporal curvature dominated |
| **3.5D Transitional** | 17.0 – 20.5 | b, c, τ, μ, s | Mixed spatial-temporal coupling; onset of time-lock |
| **3D-Dominant** | ≥ 20.5 | d, u, e | Weak temporal coupling; primarily spatial oscillators |

**[FIGURE 2 — Δt / tₚ with shaded dimensional bands at 17.0 and 20.5]**

These thresholds were selected at the mid-gaps between observed fermion clusters in log₁₀(Δt/tₚ) space.  
They correspond to transitions where the characteristic temporal wavelength crosses the balance point  
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t} \approx \frac{\hbar c}{\lambda_{\text{Compton}}},
\]
marking the trade between one spatial degree and temporal coherence.
