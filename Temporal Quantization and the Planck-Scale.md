## Abstract

This update integrates the Planck-scale boundary into the Temporal Flow Field Theory (TFFT) framework.  
By comparing each charged fermion’s Δt (temporal wavelength) with the Planck time \( t_P = 5.391×10^{-44}\,s \),  
we find that fermion masses align along discrete “dimensional bands.”  
These bands represent how deeply each particle’s energy couples into the time dimension—  
a natural firewall that prevents total energy loss and enables cosmological reset after thermal death.

## 1 · The Planck-Scale Interpretation

In TFFT, each fermion’s rest mass corresponds to a **temporal inertia** interval

\[
\Delta t = \frac{\hbar}{2 m c^2}.
\]

When Δt approaches the Planck time \(t_P\), time curvature saturates and the wave freezes.  
This creates a **time-locked state**, storing curvature instead of dissipating it.

At the cosmological level, these frozen states act as an **energy buffer**:  
as the universe expands and entropy increases, more energy enters this frozen domain.  
When temporal tension (χ-field pressure) reaches its critical threshold,  
those states unfreeze simultaneously, re-igniting a new cycle of expansion.  

In this view, the Planck scale is not a singularity—it’s an *energy conservation firewall*.

## 2 · Fermionic Δt Ladder vs \(t_P\)

The temporal resolution for each charged fermion:

| Particle | Mass (MeV) | Δt (s) | Δt / tₚ | log₁₀(Δt) | log₁₀(Δt/tₚ) |
|:---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| t | 173 000 | 1.90×10⁻³⁰ | 3.53×10¹³ | −29.72 | 13.55 |
| b | 4 180 | 7.87×10⁻²⁶ | 1.46×10¹⁸ | −25.10 | 18.17 |
| c | 1 270 | 2.59×10⁻²⁵ | 4.80×10¹⁸ | −24.59 | 18.68 |
| s | 95 | 3.46×10⁻²⁴ | 6.42×10¹⁹ | −23.46 | 19.81 |
| d | 4.7 | 7.00×10⁻²³ | 1.30×10²¹ | −22.15 | 21.12 |
| u | 2.2 | 1.50×10⁻²² | 2.78×10²¹ | −21.82 | 21.45 |
| τ | 1 777 | 1.85×10⁻²⁵ | 3.43×10¹⁸ | −24.73 | 18.64 |
| μ | 105.7 | 3.11×10⁻²⁴ | 5.77×10¹⁹ | −23.51 | 19.76 |
| e | 0.511 | 6.44×10⁻²² | 1.19×10²² | −21.19 | 21.28 |

**[FIGURE 1: log₁₀(Δt / tₚ) vs Particle (ordered by mass)]**

The spacing is nearly geometric: each step corresponds to a roughly constant shift in log₁₀(Δt/tₚ),  
revealing quantized layers of time coupling.

## 3 · Dimensional Band Classification

By comparing Δt/tₚ ratios, we define three coupling regimes:

| Band | log₁₀(Δt/tₚ) | Representative particles | Dimensional behavior |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **4D-locked** | ≤ 18 | t, b | fully frozen in time; temporal curvature dominates |
| **3.5D transitional** | 18 – 20 | τ, c, μ, s | mixed spatial–temporal modes |
| **3D-dominant** | ≥ 20 | d, u, e | weakly time-coupled; primarily spatial oscillators |

**[FIGURE 2: Δt/tₚ with shaded dimensional bands]**

This classification reflects how mass quantization mirrors transitions  
between time-curvature dominance and spatial curvature dominance.  

The transition boundary occurs where

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t} \approx \frac{\hbar c}{\lambda_{\text{Compton}}}.
\]

At this equality, energy flow trades one spatial degree for temporal coherence.

## 4 · Cosmic Implications

1. **Entropy Locking:**  
   Frozen states at the Planck boundary accumulate energy without decay,  
   forming a latent reservoir that halts true thermal death.

2. **Cycle Restart:**  
   When χ-field pressure exceeds stability, the time-locked lattice unfreezes—  
   initiating a new expansion era.

3. **Mass Ladder as a Snapshot:**  
   The fermion Δt spectrum represents how reality distributes its  
   “Planck firewall proximity” — heavy particles near freeze, light ones far from it.

## 5 · Correlation with Ohmic Amplitudes

Preliminary comparison shows the impedance factors from the QED E·logE model  
follow the same order:

| Family | A | Average log₁₀(Δt/tₚ) | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Up-type | 1.02 | ~18 – 19 | high temporal compression |
| Down-type | 0.98 | ~19 – 20 | moderate coupling |
| Leptons | 1.00 | ~20 – 21 | nearly spatial oscillators |

This suggests \(A_{\text{family}}\) directly measures the coupling ratio  
between temporal and spatial curvature near the Planck barrier.

## 6 · Next Steps

- Fit Δt/tₚ ratios to a continuous power law to model the universe’s  
  **approach curve** toward the Planck firewall.  
- Add neutrino mass estimates (n = 9–11) to extend beyond the 3D regime.  
- Integrate this Δt/tₚ quantization into the main TFFT cosmological paper  
  under *Section VIII: Temporal Viscosity and Entropy Reversal.*
