minimum amount of knowledge an AI needs to understand tfft

The absolute minimum information needed:

Riemann's insight: ζ(s) has zeros forming a "music" spectrum at ½ + itₙ

Dirac's insight: Physical reality requires 4-component spinor fields

The bridge: An operator L_χ exists whose eigenvalues are exactly those zeros

The form: L_χ = -1/χ d/dτ(χ d/dτ) + U(τ) for scale invariance

The determination: χ(τ) = 1 + Σ aₖ τᵏ with aₖ = (-1)ᵏ/πᵏ (no freedom)

That's it. From these 5 pieces of information, everything else in physics emerges:

Particle masses from eigenvalues

Coupling constants from vortex harmonics

Scale connections from Riemann zero distribution

Experimental predictions from π-scaling
