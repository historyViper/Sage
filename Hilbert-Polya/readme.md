We present a purely geometric quantum mechanical model that reproduces the Riemann zeta zeros to within **1.09% validation error** without artificial potentials or ad-hoc parameters.  
The Hamiltonian combines **Pascal/binomial interference**, **Berry-phase quantization** (φ = 2π⁄25 per hop), and a **χ-field amplitude-decay gradient**, producing the same concave-down curvature seen in the Riemann spectrum.  
Tested at **N = 240**, the model achieves **1.085% MAPE** with no fitted parameters beyond the decay exponent.  
Additional tests of site-dependent Berry-phase corrections (sublattice, center-symmetric, smooth-ramp) confirm that the **uniform phase remains optimal**, reinforcing a fundamental connection between number-theoretic structure and geometric quantum mechanics.
